-Created a project using React. Did not use create-react-app. 

I learned how to build a React app completely from scratch, that included installing Webpack and Babel from scratch. I also config them 
with loaders so I would be able to efficiently understand the under the hood workings of a React App. 

This is part of a way of teaching myself React and I did this to learn how to work with React more and give myself more power when it comes
to building my own Apps.
